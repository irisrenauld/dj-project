Explanation:
============

Home page:
============
We've divided the content of the Home page between us. Each of us has made the section in linked with their other page. 
We have made our work on another branch (Development) which was divided in three other branch with our name to work without conflicts.
We have merge the three branches in the development branch. 
When we've been in the responsive part, we've made the same protocol.

HTMl
-----
### About
One of the paragraph was in a quote tag but finally, we have changed it for a p tag.

### Disco
We've made a copy of the About us page HTML.

### releases
We have used section tag and div tag. it was a little part of the page.

### Subscribe
We have used the input tag which allow us to make a form.

### Header
 
The header's HTML had multiple versions. We didn't really know what element to put together, so we had to expermiment a bit to find a good configuration, but otherwise it wasn't a problem.
 
### Chrono
 
The HTML was straightforward and caused no issues at all.
 
### Tour
 
More info at the Tour Schedule page section
 
### Partners
 
At first the HTML was simple, but we had to add some ids and classes afterwards to be able to setup the carousel menu.
 
### News
 
The HTML was simple to structure so it was not a problem.

CSS
----
### About
The purple element on the picture was complicated to make and to place on the right emplacement. 

### Dicso
We have using the flexbox and we have copy the CSS of the About us page. 

### Release
Same issue than the About section with the purple elements.

### Subscribe
The little issue with this part was the filter for the picture. The image was more bright than the result we wanted.

### Header
 
For the CSS, positioning the elements correctly was the biggest issue. It took a long time because Thomas didn't want to use any padding or margin - don't ask him why, he wouldn't be able to explain and he still doesn't understand... Once his crisis was over, using a simple grid layout and adding **paddings** and **margins** made it a breeze. Thankfully he had experimented with a CSS only hamburger menu in another exercise so this part was pretty easy to do. Seeing the design coming together was really nice, but then came the responsive...
 
### Chrono
 
The CSS was pretty simple, we just had to figure out how to best position each element. Adding the background and being able to modify it required to use a pseudo element. The positioning of the whole div was easy but it took a bit of time to figure out
 
### Tour
 
More info at the Tour Schedule page section
 
### Partners
 
The CSS was pretty straightforward, except for the logo colors and the carousel part. For the colors, since the logos we used weren't icons nor black and white, we used filters for the first time, and it worked out ok - some elements had dark text, which we couldn't see well, but this is more an issue regarding the material used than a coding issue. For the carousel, we used links and ids to translate the elements in view at the right time and order, but it took quite a bit of time figuring it all out.
 
### News
 
We didn't encounter issues regarding the styling of the elements, but once again the carousel took a bit of time. We simply reused the same code as the Partners section, changing the required classes and ids.


Responsive
----------
### About
It wasn't complicated and we don't have an issue about this responsive part. 
### Disco
### Release
It was responsive by itself.

### Subscribe

### Header
 
It took a long time to do it correctly. We'll talk more about our issues in the Tour Schedule section, since it's the first page we did the header for.
 
### Chrono
 
The only issue we had with the responsive of the chrono was that the width was too big and caused some overflow, but it was quickly fixed.
 
### Tour
 
More info at the Tour page section
 
### Partners
 
We had little time so we did the what we could, which is resize elements so they were visible in each resolutions. We weren't able to figure out how to show more than one element in the carousel menu though.
 
### News
 
Responsive wasn't a problem, except once again for the carousel, being able to show only one item at a time.

About us page:
==============
This page was made by Iris.

HTML
-----
In the HTMl, we've no issue. 

CSS
----
The part that was very difficult was the about with the picture and the text. Using grid wasn't intuitif for someone who don't have use it before.

To simplifie the grid using, we've work with border for each different div tag. That allow us to modifie the right element. We've made it in comment when the work was perfect.

Responsive
----------
That part wasn't easy. It wasn't intuitif to modifie the grid to make the page responsive. 

Discography page:
=================
This page was made by Iris.

HTML
----
We don't have an issue with this part. It was easy and fast.

CSS
----
We have use the Flexbox attribute. So, the page was responsive by itself.

Gallery page:
=============
This page was made by Stephanie.

HTML:
-----
In the HTML, we had no issues. It's a "simple" HTML code with a header, a main, a footer and a div for the scroll button. 
In the main tag, there is a section and in this section, we choose to use a div tag for each image.

CSS:
----
In the CSS, we had chosen to use Grid to place the content as wanted. Our grid has four columns and the row are in a auto mode. We use a column-gap and a row-gap to make a blank space between each elements.

Responsive:
----------
An easy one to make. We've changed the grid-template-columns to the right number and the gap.  

Tour Schedule page:
===================
This page was made by Thomas.
 
HTML
----
 
I encountered no issues while doing the HTML part, since this page was only one big element.
 
CSS
---
 
The CSS wasn't too complex. I only struggled to center the little purple dot when you hover over a text block. Otherwise, the bulletpoints were a bit tricky but I found a way to do it quite quicly, so it wasn't too bad. The symbol on the right of the Buy Tickets link was a bit tricky too, but I thought of doing it using :after very early so it didn't take long. Everything else was pretty simple to do
 
Responsive
----------
 
The responsive was the part were I struggled the most through all of the project. This page was the first element I worked on, and it shows. The basis for the responsive was a mess, and it took me a long time to understand how to really make something responsive. There are probably a lot of problems still, but I managed to salvage my work without having to start over. Positioning and text size gave me trouble. I set a lot of my elements height directly and had to correct most of them. I think that for the next project I'll do the responsive as soon as I'm done with a page, and would like to try starting with the mobile versions.
