HTML:
-----
In the HTML, we had no issues. It's a "simple" HTML code with a header, a main, a footer and a div for the scroll button. 
In the main tag, there is a section and in this section, we choose to use a div tag for each image.

CSS:
----
In the CSS, we had chosen to use Grid to place the content as wanted. Our grid has four columns and the row are in a auto mode. We use a column-gap and a row-gap to make a blank space between each elements.
