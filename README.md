Explanation:
============
 
Home page:
============
We've divided the content of the Home page between us. Each of us has made the section in linked with their other page.

HTML
----

### Header

The header's HTML had multiple versions. We didn't really know what element to put together, so we had to expermiment a bit to find a good configuration, but otherwise it wasn't a problem.

### Chrono

The HTML was straightforward and caused no issues at all.

### Tour

More info at the Tour Schedule page section

### Partners

At first the HTML was simple, but we had to add some ids and classes afterwards to be able to setup the carousel menu.

### News

The HTML was simple to structure so it was not a problem.

CSS
---

### Header

For the CSS, positioning the elements correctly was the biggest issue. It took a long time because Thomas didn't want to use any padding or margin - don't ask him why, he wouldn't be able to explain and he still doewn't understand... Once his crisis was over, using a simple grid layout and adding **paddings** and **margins** made it a breeze. Thankfully he had experimented with a CSS only hamburger menu in another exercise so this part was pretty easy to do. Seeing the design coming together was really nice, but then came the responsive...

### Chrono

The CSS was pretty simple, we just had to figure out how to best position each element. Adding the background and being able to modify it required to use a pseudo element. The positioning of the whole div was easy but it took a bit of time to figure out

### Tour

### Partners

The CSS was pretty straightforward, except for the logo colors and the carousel part. For the colors, since the logos we used weren't icons nor black and white, we used filters for the first time, and it worked out ok - some elements had dark text, which we couldn't see well, but this is more an issue regarding the material used than a coding issue. For the carousel, we used links and ids to translate the elements in view at the right time and order, but it took quite a bit of time figuring it all out. 

### News

We didn't encounter issues regarding the styling of the elements, but once again the carousel took a bit of time. We simply reused the same code as the Partners section, changing the required classes and ids.

Responsive
----------

### Header

...the responsive. It took a long time to do it correctly. I'll talk more about my issues in the Tour Schedule section, since it's the first page.

### Chrono

The only issue we had with the responsive of the chrono was that the width was too big and caused some overflow, but it was quickly fixed.

### Tour

More info at the Tour page section

### Partners

We had little time so we did the what we could, which is resize elements so they were visible in each resolutions. We weren't able to figure out how to show more than one element in the carousel menu though.

### News

Responsive wasn't a problem, except once again for the carousel, being able to show only one item at a time.

HTML
----

I encountered no issues while doing the HTML part, since this page was only one big element.

CSS
---

The CSS wasn't too complex. I only struggled to center the little purple dot when you hover over a text block. Otherwise, the bulletpoints were a bit tricky but I found a way to do it quite quicly, so it wasn't too bad. The symbol on the right of the Buy Tickets link was a bit tricky too, but I thought of doing it using :after very early so it didn't take long. Everything else was pretty simple to do

Responsive
----------

The responsive was the part were I struggled the most through all of the project. This page was the first element I worked on, and it shows. The basis for the responsive was a mess, and it took me a long time to understand how to really make something responsive. There are probably a lot of problems still, but I managed to salvage my work without having to start over. Positioning and text size gave me trouble. I set a lot of my elements height directly and had to correct most of them. I think that for the next project I'll do the responsive as soon as I'm done with a page, and would like to try starting with the mobile versions.
