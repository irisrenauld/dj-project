We've divided the content of the Home page between us. Each of us has made the section in linked with their other page. 
We have made our work on another branch (Development) which was divided in three other branch with our name to work without conflicts.
We have merge the three branches in the development branch. 
When we've been in the responsive part, we've made the same protocol.

HTML
-----
In the HTMl, we've no issue. 

CSS
----
The part that was very difficult was the about with the picture and the text. Using grid wasn't intuitif for someone who don't have use it before.

To simplifie the grid using, we've work with border for each different div tag. That allow us to modifie the right element. We've made it in comment when the work was perfect.

Responsive
----------
That part wasn't easy. It wasn't intuitif to modifie the grid to make the page responsive.

This page was made by Stephanie.

HTML:
-----
In the HTML, we had no issues. It's a "simple" HTML code with a header, a main, a footer and a div for the scroll button. 
In the main tag, there is a section and in this section, we choose to use a div tag for each image.

CSS:
----
In the CSS, we had chosen to use Grid to place the content as wanted. Our grid has four columns and the row are in a auto mode. We use a column-gap and a row-gap to make a blank space between each elements.

Responsive:
----------
An easy one to make. We've changed the grid-template-columns to the right number and the gap.
